Using any valid static credentials, one can login to the main screen of this application that will contain the list of registered experts (currently for demo).


Steps:
* Register yourself as expert or seeker.
* If seeker, then you will be redirected to main screen containing list of experts and a drop down for some categories (predefined as of now and will be coming from server DB later in the update)
* If Expert, you need to select 1 of your expertise area of interest by which you can guide someone. And expert can also get guidance from the same page becoming as seeker.
